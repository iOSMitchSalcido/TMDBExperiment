Help !! Trying to login to tmdbs using OAuth, unable to retrieve session ID (non 2xx status code)
For practice, I'm re-writing TheMovieManager app from Udacity iOS networking course. I'm unable to 
retrieve a session ID, although every once in a while I can successfully retrieve a session ID, but
only after I reset the iPhone simulator and do a clean build.
Also, I can ALWAYS successfully retrieve a session ID when I run the version of the App that was
written by Udacity (so I don't think my powerBook, wi-fi, etc are flakey). I've tried side-by-side comparison
of the Udacity version vs my version, and nothing glaring jumps out.
I'm suspect of:
  1) Something about the App Transport settings, although I've copied the setting used in Udacity version
  2) Do I need to somehow "register" the app with TMDB before it will generate a session ID ?
  3) My code is just plain screwed up
Please Help !!
